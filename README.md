# twinslo
Repository for illustrating the twinslo approach to monitoring SLOs.

You'll need numpy, pandas, graphviz, and scikit-learn (to fix,
run `pip3 install numpy` and so on).

Running it should show some test output, but mostly it's a thin wrapper around
`DecisionTreeClassifier`. `testdata` generates the test data, and `detect` is
about the detection.
